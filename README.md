## About the Project 📝
The aim of this case study is to analyze customer purchase behavior at Walmart during Black Friday, focusing on differences in spending between male and female customers. By applying statistical techniques such as confidence intervals and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), we aim to provide actionable insights to help Walmart make data-driven decisions.

## Overview 🏬
Walmart, a leading multinational retail corporation, wants to understand if spending habits differ between male and female customers. This analysis uses a dataset containing transactional data from Black Friday, aiming to answer critical business questions regarding customer behavior.

## Dataset Description 📊
- **User_ID**: User ID
- **Product_ID**: Product ID
- **Gender**: Sex of User
- **Age**: Age in bins
- **Occupation**: Occupation (Masked)
- **City_Category**: Category of the City (A, B, C)
- **StayInCurrentCityYears**: Number of years stay in current city
- **Marital_Status**: Marital Status
- **ProductCategory**: Product Category (Masked)
- **Purchase**: Purchase Amount

## Insights 💡
1. **Spending Habits**: Analyze the average spending for male and female customers, utilizing graphical representations to visualize trends.
2. **Confidence Intervals**: Calculate confidence intervals for average spending, examining if the intervals for males and females overlap.
3. **Marital Status & Age Analysis**: Extend the analysis to marital status and age groups, assessing spending behavior across different demographics.

## Recommendations 📈
1. **Targeted Marketing**: Based on spending habits, tailor marketing campaigns to target specific gender groups during peak shopping times like Black Friday.
2. **Inventory Management**: Use insights from spending patterns to adjust inventory for high-demand products, ensuring stock availability during key sales events.
3. **Customer Engagement**: Develop programs or loyalty benefits for demographic groups that show higher spending, enhancing customer retention.

## Future Analysis 🔍
- **Longitudinal Studies**: Conduct ongoing analysis over multiple Black Friday events to track changes in spending habits.
- **Cross-Category Analysis**: Investigate spending across different product categories to identify trends and opportunities for promotions.
- **Behavioral Segmentation**: Explore clustering techniques to segment customers based on more granular behavioral patterns, enhancing personalization strategies.

## Data Exploration 🔢

### 3. Univariate Analysis
- Conduct univariate analysis using histograms and boxplots to explore distributions of continuous variables.

### 4. Bivariate Analysis
- Perform bivariate analysis to investigate relationships between categorical and continuous variables, utilizing heatmaps and pairplots.

## Statistical Analysis 📉

### 1. Average Spending Analysis
- Calculate the average spending for male and female customers, documenting findings and interpretations.

### 2. Confidence Interval Calculation
- Determine the confidence intervals for both genders using sample averages and discuss implications.

### 3. CLT Observations
- Apply the Central Limit Theorem to assess the behavior of sample means with different sample sizes, observing the normality of distributions.

## Final Insights 🎯
Summarize the findings from the analyses, noting the implications for Walmart's strategy based on the observed customer spending behavior.
